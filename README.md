HAB Solr
==

This library implements facetted Solr search. It started as a spin-off of [VuFind's search component](https://github.com/vufind-org)
but simplified the communication with the Solr backend. It implements the [Command pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern)
and provides customizable access to facets. The concept of generic *parameter providers* and *response consumers* makes it
easy to implemented access to Solr features not covered by this library.
